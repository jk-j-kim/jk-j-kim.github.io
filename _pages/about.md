 I’m a final year graduate student at the TU Berlin.

🔬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I’m currently working towards my Master’s Thesis in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.


Originally from Seoul, I am a masters student in Duke University's Statistical Science department. I have an undergraduate background in Business Administration and Statistics, and am interested in solving business questions with data. Some specific problems that I am interested in include: 0000




to UMass Amherst to study Mathematics and Computer Science. After applying to programs focusing on using mathematics or statistics to solve problems related to understanding relational data, I decided to join the statistics department at Duke as a PhD student. Some specific problems I’m particularly interested in are applications of latent space graphical models, community detection, and building scalable graph systems. At UMass, I most enjoyed my time as a teaching assistant for Calculus 1 as it gave me the opportunity to teach students directly. In my free-time I like to read, create generative art, listen to music, and watch baseball. I have been fortunate enough to pursue opportunities at General Dynamics Mission Systems, Johns Hopkins University: Applied Physics Lab, DraftKings, and Datadog. In addition, I was a research and development intern at Genentech working on the Epiviz project and an intern on the Machine Learning Accelerators team at Cruise.
