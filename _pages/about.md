Originally from Seoul, Korea, I am currently a master's student in Duke University's Department of Statistical Science. I completed my undergraduate studies at Korea University, where I double-majored in Business Administration and Statistics, and I am passionate about solving business problems through data.

I have gained practical experience through internships and consulting club activities across diverse industries, including retail, healthcare, real estate, and IT. My work has spanned global consulting companies as well as local and international startups, where I consistently worked with data in various contexts and applications. 

Currently, I am particularly interested in research focused on developing personalized recommendation systems, and am aiming to pursue a PhD in Quantitative Marketing.
